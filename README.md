### Description
This website displays the current best selling games in the form of a table in the **home page**. It allows users to purchase these games through a cart system on 
the home page which then displays the total in cart to the user as an alert and on the far right of the nav bar. A user can find out more about the game quickly by just 
clicking on the image of the game. They can also access the cart and complete their purchase by clicking on **My Cart** in the nav bar.

### Installation
To run the code on your local machine just download the code as a zip file and extract it on your machine, then open the file and open **LandingPage.html** using chrome. 
This will run the website locally and work as intended. If you want to open the other file and view the code use a text editor to open them with such as _visual studio 
code_.

### Usage
The website works best when the first page you open is the landing page and then navigate to the other pages. The landing page should look like the image below with the 
background color changing every few seconds.

Once you've clicked on _Browse Now_ you will be taken to the home page which displays all the games. Hovering over a picture will enlarge it slightly and clicking on it 
will display a dialog box with more information.

From the nav bar you can navigate to a **Contact us** page, a **Sign up** page and the **My Cart** page with their own respective looks. You can also click on the more 
button below the image of a game to go to a page with just that games information. The image below shows the **My Cart** page where the total now has vat added on.

From here you can select whether you would like to pick up the order, have it delivered and whether or not you have a coupon. Depending on the coupon and the means of 
delivery the total will change dynamically. Once the relative fields have been selected you can place your order. _Clicking on delivery or collection will hide the other 
option_.
